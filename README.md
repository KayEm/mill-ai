# Introduction

Everyone has played "Mills" or "Nine Men's Morris". But on the computer? Against a self-written computer opponent? That sounds exciting!

The special thing is that you are not playing against another person, but against an AI. An AI that I develop myself and which calculates its own move. When the human player has made a turn, the AI is next and calculates its move.

Idea from [Kampf gegen Mühlen 2017. Entwickle Deine Mühle-KI!](https://www.it-talents.de/foerderung/code-competition/code-competition-10-2017)
