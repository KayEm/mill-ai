#Introduction

Everyone has  played "Mills" or "Nine Men's Morris". But on the computer? Against a self-written computer opponent? That sounds exciting!

The special thing is that you are not playing against another person, but against an AI. An AI that I develop myself and which calculates its own move.

Classic mill playing board on which the player can perform moves.
Display with GUI in WPF.
An AI against which the human is playing (When the human player has made a turn, the AI is next and calculates its move).
Rules of the mill.
